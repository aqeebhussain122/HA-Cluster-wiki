What is a DRBD Cluster?

Solution of creating DRBD Cluster:
	1. Integrate VBOX with Vagrant
	2. Configure Vagrant to have each PC carry a seperate IP address
	3. Enable and install repo of DRBD on each node (VM1 & VM2) rpm -ivh http://www.elrepo.org/elrepo-release-7.0-2.el7.elrepo.noarch.rpm
	4.

#Troubleshooting in Virtualbox
Virtualbox is known to not share it's IP addresses, a quick fix if you're using CentOS machines is to go into file -> preferences -> Network. From this point you need to select a NatNetwork, going forward you should then go into the settings of the VBOX machine and assign the machine to a NatNetwork. (Do this with both machines)
Once the machine is configured you should then be able to have an individual IP address for each machine involved
